file:light_portal_and_tentacle
0-10 portal opens
10-210 portal idle spin
210-220 portal closes
40-200 tentacle emerges and retracts

(light_portal_alpha)just use this file for 
transparency on the portals and add the glowing white material 
we have for everything else if you need the alpha made 
into an other format just let me know

head
file:boss_head
0-121 opening
121-361 idle
361-445 roar and head slam



ignore the boss_anim files it was a test 
in case we where to use the character as a boss 
with some changes


death animation slow down the slam animations a bit so the head and tentacles 
hit the ground and freeze them in position
